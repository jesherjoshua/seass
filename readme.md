# Seass - Google Solution Challenge 2023


The Google Solution Challenge aims to build a solution to a local problem using Google technologies, in accordance with one or more of the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The Solution Challenge is open to members of Google Developer Student Clubs.

## Description

The project aims to detect and count underwater trash using AI and map the data on a world map to help tackle ocean pollution.

## Problem Statement:
Marine litter, particularly plastic debris, has become a significant environmental issue, with significant negative impacts on ocean ecosystems and the organisms that inhabit them. Monitoring, detecting, and mapping underwater trash are critical components in addressing this challenge.

Current methods for detecting and counting underwater trash are often manual and time-consuming, making it challenging to track changes over time and develop targeted mitigation strategies. Additionally, the mapping of underwater trash data is often limited, hindering efforts to understand the scope of the problem and develop appropriate interventions.

## Approach:
To address this challenge, the project aims to utilize AI and cloud resources to automate and streamline the detection, counting, and mapping of underwater trash. By leveraging cloud functions, cloud run, cloud storage, Vertex AI workbench, BigQuery, and cloud storage triggers, the project seeks to develop a comprehensive and real-time system for monitoring and addressing ocean pollution.

## Round 1 updates
